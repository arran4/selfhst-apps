    <content>&lt;p&gt;Unbound 1.19.3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release has a number of bug fixes. The CNAME synthesized for a
DNAME record uses the original TTL, of the DNAME record, and that means
it can be cached for the TTL, instead of 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fix that when a message was stored in cache, but one of the
RRsets was not updated due to cache policy, it now restricts the message
TTL if the cache version of the RRset has a shorter TTL. It avoids a
bug where the message is not expired, but its contents is expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dnstap, it logs type DoH and DoT correctly, if that is used for
the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The b.root-servers.net address is updated in the default root hints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When performing retries for failed sends, a retry at a smaller UDP size
is now not performed when that attempt is not actually smaller, and at
defaults, since the flag day changes, it is the same size. This makes
it skip the step, it is useless because there is no reduction in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients with a valid DNS Cookie will bypass the ratelimit, if one is
set. The value from ip-ratelimit-cookie is used for these queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore there is a fix to make correct EDE Prohibited answers for
access control denials, and a fix for EDNS client subnet scope zero
answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features:
- Merge PR #973: Use the origin (DNAME) TTL for synthesized CNAMEs as
  per RFC 6672.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bug Fixes:
- Fix unit test parse of origin syntax.
- Use 127.0.0.1 explicitly in tests to avoid delays and errors on
  newer systems.
- Fix #964: config.h.in~ backup file in release tar balls.
- Merge #968: Replace the obsolescent fgrep with grep -F in tests.
- Merge #971: fix 'WARNING: Message has 41 extra bytes at end'.
- Fix #969: [FR] distinguish Do53, DoT and DoH in the logs.
- Fix dnstap that assertion failed on logging other than UDP and TCP
  traffic. It lists it as TCP traffic.
- Fix to sync the tests script file common.sh.
- iana portlist update.
- Updated IPv4 and IPv6 address for b.root-servers.net in root hints.
- Update test script file common.sh.
- Fix tests to use new common.sh functions, wait_logfile and
  kill_from_pidfile.
- Fix #974: doc: default number of outgoing ports without libevent.
- Merge #975: Fixed some syntax errors in rpl files.
- Fix root_zonemd unit test, it checks that the root ZONEMD verifies,
  now that the root has a valid ZONEMD.
- Update example.conf with cookie options.
- Merge #980: DoH: reject non-h2 early. To fix #979: Improve errors
  for non-HTTP/2 DoH clients.
- Merge #985: Add DoH and DoT to dnstap message.
- Fix #983: Sha1 runtime insecure change was incomplete.
- Remove unneeded newlines and improve indentation in remote control
  code.
- Merge #987: skip edns frag retry if advertised udp payload size is
  not smaller.
- Fix unit test for #987 change in udp1xxx retry packet send.
- Merge #988: Fix NLnetLabs#981: dump_cache truncates large records.
- Fix to link with -lcrypt32 for OpenSSL 3.2.0 on Windows.
- Fix to link with libssp for libcrypto and getaddrinfo check for
  only header. Also update crosscompile to remove ssp for 32bit.
- Merge #993: Update b.root-servers.net also in example config file.
- Update workflow for ports to use newer openssl on windows compile.
- Fix warning for windres on resource files due to redefinition.
- Fix for #997: Print details for SSL certificate failure.
- Update error printout for duplicate trust anchors to include the
  trust anchor name (relates to #920).
- Update message TTL when using cached RRSETs. It could result in
  non-expired messages with expired RRSETs (non-usable messages by
  Unbound).
- Merge #999: Search for protobuf-c with pkg-config.
- Fix #1006: Can't find protobuf-c package since #999.
- Fix documentation for access-control in the unbound.conf man page.
- Merge #1010: Mention REFUSED has the TC bit set with unmatched
  allow_cookie acl in the manpage. It also fixes the code to match the
  documentation about clients with a valid cookie that bypass the
  ratelimit regardless of the allow_cookie acl.
- Document the suspend argument for process_ds_response().
- Move github workflows to use checkoutv4.

  in the global cache, and in cachedb, when the upstream replies
  without an EDNS record.
- Fix for #1022: Fix ede prohibited in access control refused answers.
- Fix unbound-control-setup.cmd to use 3072 bits so that certificates
  are long enough for newer OpenSSL versions.
- Fix TTL of synthesized CNAME when a DNAME is used from cache.
- Fix unbound-control-setup.cmd to have CA v3 basicConstraints,
  like unbound-control-setup.sh has.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Unbound: Unbound 1.20.0</title>
    <updated>2024-05-08T05:06:15-04:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>NLnetLabs/unbound</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;Unbound 1.20.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release has a fix for the DNSBomb issue CVE-2024-33655. This has a
low severity for Unbound, since it makes Unbound complicit in targeting
others, but does not affect Unbound so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the issue new configuration options are introduced.
The options &lt;code&gt;discard-timeout: 1900&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wait-limit: 1000&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;wait-limit-cookie: 10000&lt;/code&gt; are enabled by default. They limit the
number of outstanding queries that a querier can have. This limits
the reply pulse, and make Unbound less favorable for the issue.
With the config &lt;code&gt;wait-limit-netblock&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wait-limit-cookie-netblock&lt;/code&gt;
the parameters can be fine tuned for specific destinations.
More information on the attack and Unbound's mitigations are
presented further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other fixes in this release are that Unbound no longer follows symlinks
when truncating the pidfile. Unbound also does not chown the pidfile,
this is for safety reasons. There are also a number of fixes for RPZ, in
handling CNAMEs. There is a memory leak fix for the edns client subnet
cache. For DNSSEC validation a case is fixed when the query is of type
DNAME. The unbound-anchor program is fixed to first write to a temporary
file, before replacing the original. This handles disk full situations,
and because of it unbound-anchor needs permission to create that file,
in the same directory as the original file. There is also a fix for
IP_DONTFRAG, to disable fragmentation instead of the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The option &lt;code&gt;cache-min-negative-ttl&lt;/code&gt; can be used to set the minimum TTL
for negative responses in the cache. It complements existing options to
set the maximum ttl for negative responses and to set the minimum and
maximum ttl but not specifically for negative responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The option &lt;code&gt;cachedb-check-when-serve-expired&lt;/code&gt; option makes Unbound use
cachedb to check for expired responses, when &lt;code&gt;serve-expired&lt;/code&gt; is enabled,
and cachedb is used. It is enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-q&lt;/code&gt; option for unbound-checkconf can be added to silence it when
there are no errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNSBomb vulnerability CVE-2024-33655.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== Summary
The DNSBomb attack, via specially timed DNS queries and answers, can
cause a Denial of Service on resolvers and spoofed targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbound itself is not vulnerable for DoS, rather it can be used to take
part in a pulsing DoS amplification attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbound 1.20.0 includes fixes so the impact of the DoS from Unbound
is significantly lower than it used to be and making the attack, and
Unbound's participation, less tempting for attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== Affected products
Unbound up to and including 1.19.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== Description
The DNSBomb attack works by sending low-rate spoofed queries for a
malicious zone to Unbound. By controlling the delay of the malicious
authoritative answers, Unbound slowly accumulates pending answers for
the spoofed addresses. When the authoritative answers become available
to Unbound at the same time, Unbound starts serving all the accumulated
queries. This results into large-sized, concentrated response bursts to
the spoofed addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From version 1.20.0 on, Unbound introduces a couple of configuration
options to help mitigate the impact.
Their complete description can be found in the included manpages but
they are also briefly listed here together with their default values for
convenience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;discard-timeout: 1900
  After 1900 ms a reply to the client will be dropped.
  Unbound would still work on the query but refrain from replying in
  order to not accumulate a huge number of "old" replies.
  Legitimate clients retry on timeouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wait-limit: 1000
  wait-limit-cookie: 10000
  Limits the amount of client queries that require recursion
  (cache-hits are not counted) per IP address. More recursive queries
  than the allowed limit are dropped. Clients with a valid EDNS Cookie
  can have a different limit, higher by default.
  wait-limit: 0 disables all wait limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wait-limit-netblock
  wait-limit-cookie-netblock
  These do not have a default value but they can fine grain
  configuration for specific netblocks. With or without EDNS Cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options above are trying to shrink the DNSBomb window so that the
impact of the DoS from Unbound is significantly lower than it used to be
and making the attack, and Unbound's participation, less tempting for
attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Xiang Li from the Network and Information
Security Lab of Tsinghua University for discovering and disclosing the
attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features
- The config for discard-timeout, wait-limit, wait-limit-cookie,
  wait-limit-netblock and wait-limit-cookie-netblock was added, for
  the fix to the DNSBomb issue.

    <title>New release for Unbound: Unbound 1.21.0</title>
    <updated>2024-08-15T04:56:18-04:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Unbound 1.21.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release has a fix for the CAMP and CacheFlush issues. They have a
low severity for Unbound, since it does not affect Unbound so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Compositional Amplification (CAMP) type of attacks can lead to DoS
attacks against DNS servers. In Unbound legitimate client requests to
the resolvers under typical workload are not directly affected by CAMP
attacks. However we introduce a global quota for 128 outgoing packets
per query (and it's subqueries) that is never reset to prevent the
combination of CAMP with other amplification attacks in the future. We
would like to thank Huayi Duan, Marco Bearzi, Jodok Vieli, and Cagin
Tanir from NetSec group, ETH Zurich for discovering and notifying us
about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CacheFlush type of attacks (NSCacheFlush, CNAMECacheFlush) try to
evict cached data by utilizing rogue zones and a steady rogue stream to
a resolver. Based on the zone, the stream, the configured cache size
and the legitimate traffic, Unbound could experience a degradation of
service if a useful entry is evicted and Unbound needs to resolve again.
As a mitigation to the NSCacheFlush attack Unbound is setting a limit
of 20 RRs in an NS RRset. We would like to thank Yehuda Afek, Anat
Bremler-Barr, Shoham Danino and Yuval Shavitt (Tel-Aviv University and
Reichman University) for discovering and notifying us about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other fixes in this release are bug fixes. Also the unbound control
commands that flush the cache can clear both the memory and cachedb
module cache. The ipset module can use BSD pf tables. The new option
&lt;code&gt;dnstap-sample-rate: 100&lt;/code&gt; can be used to log 1/N messages, for use in
high volume server environments where the log server does not keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new DNSSEC key for the root, 38696 from 2024 has been added. It is
added to the default root keys in unbound-anchor. The content can be
inspected with &lt;code&gt;unbound-anchor -l&lt;/code&gt;. Older versions of Unbound can keep
up with the root key with &lt;code&gt;auto-trust-anchor-file&lt;/code&gt; that has RFC5011
key rollover. Also unbound-anchor can fetch the keys from the website
with a certificate if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cookie secrets, it is possible to perform rollover. The file
with cookie secret in use and the staging secret is configured
with &lt;code&gt;cookie-secret-file&lt;/code&gt;. With the remote control the rollover can be
performed, add_cookie_secret, activate_cookie_secret, drop_cookie_secret
and print_cookie_secrets can be used for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the RC1, the release has a fix for module loading on Windows,
and a spelling correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features
- Fix #1071: [FR] Clear both in-memory and cachedb module cache with
  &lt;code&gt;unbound-control flush*&lt;/code&gt; commands.
- Fix #144: Port ipset to BSD pf tables.
- Add dnstap-sample-rate that logs only 1/N messages, for high volume
  server environments. Thanks Dan Luther.
- Add root key 38696 from 2024 for DNSSEC validation. It is added
  to the default root keys in unbound-anchor. The content can be
  inspected with &lt;code&gt;unbound-anchor -l&lt;/code&gt;.
- Merge #1090: Cookie secret file. Adds
  &lt;code&gt;cookie-secret-file: "unbound_cookiesecrets.txt"&lt;/code&gt; option to store
  cookie secrets for EDNS COOKIE secret rollover. The remote control
  add_cookie_secret, activate_cookie_secret and drop_cookie_secret
  commands can be used for rollover, the command print_cookie_secrets
  shows the values in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bug Fixes
- Fix CAMP issues with global quota. Thanks to Huayi Duan, Marco
  Bearzi, Jodok Vieli, and Cagin Tanir from NetSec group, ETH Zurich.

  when validation fails due to the missing DNSKEY. Also for key prime
  and DS lookups.
- Fix for neater printout for error for missing DS response.
- Fix neater printout.
- Fix #1099: Unbound core dump on SIGSEGV.
- Fix for #1099: Fix to check for deleted RRset when the contents
  is updated and fetched after it is stored, and also check for a
  changed RRset.
- Don't check for message TTL changes if the RRsets remain the same.
- Fix that validation reason failure that uses string print uses
  separate buffer that is passed, from the scratch validation buffer.
- Fixup algo_needs_reason string buffer length.
- Fix shadowed error string variable in validator dnskey handling.
- Update list of known EDE codes.
- For #773: In contrib/unbound.service.in set unbound to start after
  network-online.target. Also for contrib/unbound_portable.service.in.
- Fix #1103: unbound 1.20.0 segmentation fault with nghttp2.
- For #1103: fix to also drop mesh state reference when a h2 reply is
  dropped.
- Add RPZ tag tests in acl_interface.tdir.
- For #1102: clearer text for using interface-* options for the
  loopback interface.
- For #1103: fix to also drop mesh state reference when the discard
  limit is reached, when there is an error making a new recursion
  state and when the connection is dropped with is_drop.
- For #1103: Fix to drop mesh state reference for the http2 stream
  associated with the reply, not the currently active stream. And
  it does not remove it twice on a mesh_send_reply call. The reply
  h2_stream is NULL when not in use, for more initialisation.
- Fix dnstap wakeup, a running wakeup timer is left to expire and not
  increased, a timer is started when the dtio thread is sleeping,
  the timer set disabled when the dtio thread goes to sleep, and
  after sleep the thread checks to see if there are messages to log
  immediately.
- Merge #1110: Make fallthrough explicit for libworker.c.
- For #1110: Test for fallthrough attribute in configure and add
  fallthrough attribute annotations.
- Fix compile when the compiler does not support the noreturn
  attribute.
- Fix to have empty definition when not supported for weak attribute.
- Fix uninitialized variable warning in create_tcp_accept_sock.
- Fix link of dnstap without openssl.
- Fix link of unbound-dnstap-socket without openssl.
- Fix #1106: ratelimit-below-domain logs the wrong FROM address.
- Cleanup ede.tdir test.
- For #935 and #1104, clarify RPZ order and semantics.
- Fix to document parameters of auth_zone_verify_zonemd_with_key.
- Fix for #1114: Fix that cache fill for forward-host names is
  performed, so that with nonzero target-fetch-policy it fetches
  forwarder addresses and uses them from cache. Also updated that
  delegation point cache fill routines use CDflag for AAAA message
  lookups, so that its negative lookup stops a recursion since the
  cache uses the bit for disambiguation for dns64 but the recursion
  uses CDflag for the AAAA target lookups, so the check correctly
  stops a useless recursion by its cache lookup.
- Fix dnstap test program, cleans up to have clean memory on exit,
  for tap_data_free, does not delete NULL items. Also it does not try
  to free the tail, specifically in the free of the list since that
  picked up the next item in the list for its loop causing invalid
  free. Added internal unit test to unbound-dnstap-socket for that.
- Fix that the worker mem report with alloc stats does not attempt
  to print memory use of forwards and hints if they have been
  deleted already.
- Fix that alloc stats has strdup checks, it stops debuggers from
  complaining about mismatch at free time.
- Fix testbound for alloc stats strdup in util/alloc.c.
- Fix that alloc stats for forwards and hints are printed, and when
  alloc stats is enabled, the unit test for unbound control waits for
  reloads to complete.
- Fix that for windows the module startup is called and sets up
  the module-config.
- Fix spelling for the cache-min-negative-ttl entry in the
  example.conf.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Unbound: Unbound 1.21.1</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This security release fixes CVE-2024-8508.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability has been discovered in Unbound when handling replies
with very large RRsets that Unbound needs to perform name compression
for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound
to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream
replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of
service in well orchestrated attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound
for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large
RRsets.
Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name
compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU
until the whole packet was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name
compression calculations it is willing to do per packet.
Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed
packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid
locking the CPU for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change should not affect normal DNS traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank Toshifumi Sakaguchi for discovering and
responsibly disclosing the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bug Fixes:
- Fix CVE-2024-8508, unbounded name compression could lead to denial of
  service. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Unbound: Unbound 1.22.0</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Unbound 1.22.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release has an option to harden against unverified glue, it
is enabled with &lt;code&gt;harden-unverified-glue: yes&lt;/code&gt;. It was contributed
by Karthik Umashankar from Microsoft. This protects Unbound against
bad glue, that is out of zone, by performing a lookup for it.
Because it uses the original information as a last resort if nothing
works, it should not give lookup failures, and add protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are options to configure the scrubbing for NS records and
the CNAME scrubbing and the max global quota lookup limit from
previous security fix releases. They can be configured with the
options &lt;code&gt;iter-scrub-ns&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;iter-scrub-cname&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max-global-quota&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For redis use, with cachedb, it is possible to specify the
timeout for the initial connection separately from the timeout
for commands. With the options &lt;code&gt;redis-command-timeout: 20&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;redis-connect-timeout: 200&lt;/code&gt; they can be set separately, for
a longer connect attempt, but a short command timeout to keep
resolution faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to log with ISO8601 format with &lt;code&gt;log-time-iso: yes&lt;/code&gt;
this also logs time in milliseconds. Useful if the server writes to
file, syslog may have its own format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS over QUIC is support is added, if compiled with libngtcp2 and
with the openssl+quic that it uses. Use &lt;code&gt;--with-libngtcp2&lt;/code&gt; for that,
and enable it with &lt;code&gt;quic-port: 853&lt;/code&gt;. There is a post about it
on https://blog.nlnetlabs.nl/dns-over-quic-in-unbound [that is to
appear after the release].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features
- Add iter-scrub-ns, iter-scrub-cname and max-global-quota
  configuration options.
- Merge patch to fix for glue that is outside of zone, with
  &lt;code&gt;harden-unverified-glue&lt;/code&gt;, from Karthik Umashankar (Microsoft).
  Enabling this option protects the Unbound resolver against bad
  glue, that is unverified out of zone glue, by resolving them.
  It uses the records as last resort if there is no other working
  glue.
- Add redis-command-timeout: 20 and redis-connect-timeout: 200,
  that can set the timeout separately for commands and the
  connection set up to the redis server. If they are not
  specified, the redis-timeout value is used.
- Fix #1144: [FR] log timestamps in ISO8601 format with timezone.
  This adds the option &lt;code&gt;log-time-iso: yes&lt;/code&gt; that logs in ISO8601
  format.
- Merge #871: DNS over QUIC. This adds &lt;code&gt;quic-port: 853&lt;/code&gt; and
  &lt;code&gt;quic-size: 8m&lt;/code&gt; that enable dnsoverquic, and the counters
  &lt;code&gt;num.query.quic&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mem.quic&lt;/code&gt; in the statistics output.
  The feature needs to be enabled by compiling with libngtcp2,
  with &lt;code&gt;--with-libngtcp2=path&lt;/code&gt; and libngtcp2 needs openssl+quic,
  pass that with &lt;code&gt;--with-ssl=path&lt;/code&gt; to compile unbound as well.&lt;/p&gt;
