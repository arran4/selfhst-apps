    <content>&lt;h2&gt;We're live! ðŸŒ® ðŸ¥³&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="the-office-the" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28a3e1e1-027b-4f94-abd3-89d34c76d05b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hundreds of contributors and hundreds of thousands of lines of code, &lt;code&gt;v0.1.0&lt;/code&gt; is here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release comes with a TON of bug fixes and marks the launch of "hosted" Maybe.  We've still got a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of work ahead, but we're excited to release our first production-ready version of Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're currently in a private, invite-only alpha.  Be sure to &lt;a href="https://link.maybe.co/discord"&gt;join our Discord&lt;/a&gt; for announcements when new spots become available!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first version, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add all of your accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import accounts, transactions, and trades by CSV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See your net worth, total spending, and total income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage transactions (categories, tags, notes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage investment portfolios (buys, sells, deposits, withdrawals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we incorporate all the feedback coming in, our hosted app will be introducing automated bank syncing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Plaid Integration + Multi-currency Investment Portfolio Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have completed the first pass at our fully automated bank syncing with Plaid on our &lt;em&gt;hosted version&lt;/em&gt; of the app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated bank syncing is a huge milestone for the app and includes many UI improvements, accuracy improvements, and bug fixes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editing transactions is now much smoother&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Account history can be calculated chronologically and reverse-chronologically (required for Plaid accounts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-currency investment accounts are now available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment accounts now properly calculate "brokerage cash" vs. "holdings value" and break this out clearly in the view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment accounts calculate cost basis more accurately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CleanShot 2024-12-13 at 12 31 03" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fdbab79-7bc5-4631-80b4-a708df1783fd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can I self-host Plaid?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an open-source project, self-hosters are more than welcome to configure (and pay for) their own Plaid accounts.  You can see the &lt;code&gt;.env.example&lt;/code&gt; file for the required api keys that need to be provided to the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, due to the complexity around OAuth, Plaid's pricing structure, and costs associated with a personal Plaid subscription, we will not be officially supporting this setup.  The hosted version of our app has full Plaid support and is our recommended way to get access to automated bank syncing (more invites coming soon!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix registration fails silently when there are errors by @tonyvince in https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/1455&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Make encryption config optional for self hosting users by @zachgoll in https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/1476&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow custom column separator for CSV parsing in uploads controller by @acflint in https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/1470&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix transfers and form currencies by @zachgoll in https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/1477&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't refresh page when transaction details are edited by @zachgoll in https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/1479&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add post-sync UI stream updates by @zachgoll in https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/1482&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculates trend based on previous transaction's balance on the same date by @nicogaldamez in https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/1483&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replaced Native Scrollbars with Tailwind Scrollbars on Windows by @jestinjoshi in https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/1493&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix bug: Loan % doesn't allow exact rate by @arsenstorm in https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/1492&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix Account Disabling UI by @arsenstorm in https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/1491&lt;/li&gt;

    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Budgeting is here!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long awaited feature, Maybe now supports budgeting!  We believe budgeting should be easy and simple.  Categorize your transactions, mark transfers, one-time expenses, and get a clear breakdown of where your money is going each month.&lt;/p&gt;
