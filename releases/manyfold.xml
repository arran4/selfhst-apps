    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.109.0</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Some new features for admins in this release, and some metadata parse and import improvements! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a &lt;code&gt;bin/manyfold&lt;/code&gt; command that can do various admin tasks, like cleaning up incorrect data; the &lt;a href="https://manyfold.app/sysadmin/advanced_tasks.html"&gt;Advanced Tasks&lt;/a&gt; page on the website explains how to use it.  You can now also set an upload quota for accounts, handy if you're running a public instance. You can set a site-wide default, then override it for each account individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metdata parsing has been improved and made more reliable; "rescan all models" in the menu and "rescan all files" in a single model both now do the same thing, and will re-parse metadata from path templates and other sources. A new source for metadata is README files; they're now read into the model description automatically, but if it's a Thingiverse-formatted README, we also automatically try to set creator, title, and license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ú® New Features ‚ú®&lt;/h3&gt;

    <content>&lt;p&gt;We had a bug with saving user preferences in the last release, due to a dependency upgrade. We should have caught it, but it slipped by us. It's now fixed, but unfortunately if you experienced the bug, your preferences will be set back to the defaults; fortunately that's just user-level things though, like problem severities, and various display options like renderer, pagination, and tag cloud. Sorry for the inconvenience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üêõ Bug Fixes üêõ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix error with parameter format on user settings page by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/4113&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üõ†Ô∏è Other Improvements üõ†Ô∏è&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove no longer needed allow_api_access method by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/4101&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve download creation process by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/4102&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.110.0</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Because of some medical issues (don't get old, folks), it's been an unusually long time between releases. But, that just means that this is a big one! And oh boy, it's a big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Downloads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, we've got improvements to downloads; you now get a visual hint that your download zipfile will need to be created, and when you click, it'll update the button state when it's ready. There are also options for site admins to proactively create ZIP downloads and set how long they're kept; if you're running a site with lots of downloading, you might want them instantly available, at the cost of disk space of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Faster page loading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we've got some new client-side technology that enables the live updates; using &lt;a href="https://hotwired.dev"&gt;Hotwire&lt;/a&gt;, using your instance should now feel much faster, and act more like a client-side app. That also means that you'll see updates to models live as they happen; if you rescan, or upload some files, they'll appear in the page without you having to reload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New "original" rendering mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manyfold is seeing use not just in 3D printing, but in the game development world, and in that case, showing an untextured model isn't really right. Our new "original" rendering mode uses the textures and materials from the file itself, so complex formats like glTF, FBX, and more, will show the model as it really should look, while falling back to the usual preferences for models that don't have any of that stuff. This also comes with indexing of .bin files for glTF, and preview rendering for DRACO, FBX, and 3DS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GCODE previews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest assured we've not forgotten about print though; we've also added rendering for GCode files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Better search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's a whole new search syntax, with powerful boolean operations, the ability to search specific fields, and more. Under the search box you'll see a new "search syntax" link, which will bring up a help box that explains it all. Search now also includes model descriptions and captions, and even filenames!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ú® New Features ‚ú®&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Show download readiness state on download buttons by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/4121&lt;/li&gt;
