    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.104.0</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This release makes it easier to include content from Manyfold elsewhere on the web, by adding support for the oEmbed standard. On many blog platforms, you should now be able to just paste in a public model, creator or collection URL, and get a nice preview. If the platform you're using allows it, you might even get a proper 3D view if you've got a model selected as the preview file!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also got two long-requested features for you; deleting libraries (finally), and the ability to open a file directly in your slicer. Currently OrcaSlicer and Cura are supported, but we will add more in future when we can! We could do PrusaSlicer and Bambu Studio as well, but they will only open files from Printables or Makerworld respectively; perhaps in time we can convince them to open that up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This release sees the first proper API endpoints for public models, creators and collections. It's a pretty standard JSON-LD REST API, and should be considered version zero; it will definitely change over time, but we're excited to see what can be done with it! Full documentation is at &lt;code&gt;/api&lt;/code&gt; on every instance (including on &lt;a href="https://try.manyfold.app/api"&gt;Try Manyfold&lt;/a&gt;), and is linked in the site footer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authenticated access tokens for accessing private data will be coming soon, followed by being able to edit data and upload content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;API improvements, linking resources together and improving JSON-LD by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3824&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.106.0</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T06:56:12-04:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;There's a HUGE changelist in this release, because we've spent some time on a whole load of features for people running public servers as well as the usual collection of bugfixes and minor improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the appearance and customisation options are now built in to the settings pages, so the old SITE_NAME environment variables have gone away; you can also open and close signups from within settings. There's a new about page, a place to specify server rules and a donation link, and a change to how site statistics are displayed which makes more sense for big instances. Add on email notifications, editable fediverse usernames, and the list gets pretty huge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a brand new translation into Czech, courtesy of @ichlubna, bringing us to 6 languages now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's quite a big UI change though - you may notice that libraries have disappeared. We found that in general people don't use them for organisation, and on public instances they're confusing, so we've hidden them away by default. Now they're really just a way to configure storage locations. You can set default library for uploads, and admins can still move models between libraries. Don't worry though, if you want it back how it was before, you can enable the previous behaviour in the site appearance settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üí• Breaking Changes üí•&lt;/h3&gt;
