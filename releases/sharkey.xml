    <title>New release for Sharkey: 2024.8.1</title>
    <updated>2024-09-13T19:00:50+00:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;User visible changes:
* You can now search your drive files by name or description.
* You can now disable the "edited" notifications.
* When you block a user, they're now also muted, so you won't see their notes even if they get boosted into your timeline (you can un-mute them if you want).
* "My Plays" page now shows the visibility of plays without clicking into each individual play.
* Users can now report pages, galleries, and plays.
* Follow requests from suspended accounts are no longer shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of interest to admins:
* Password checks and websocket connections are rate limited now; this improves security and resistance to denial-of-service attacks.
* When an admin deletes all files of another user, those deletions are logged in the moderation log.
* All memory caches are now limited, Sharkey should use less RAM overall.
* new setting &lt;code&gt;attachLdSignatureForRelays&lt;/code&gt; to disable sending LD-Signatures to relays.
* More checks at startup: db reachability, config file presence.
* URL previews are cached on the server, this should reduce the load on websites that get linked in popular notes.
* Remote documents that return &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; but specify &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/activity+json" href="..."/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags are now supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some column sizes have changed; upstream recommendeds to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sql
DROP INDEX "public"."IDX_e5848eac4940934e23dbc17581";
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY "IDX_e5848eac4940934e23dbc17581" ON "drive_file" ("uri");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;manually on your database&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Sharkey: 2024.8.2</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Of interest to admins:
- A pretty bad memory leak has been fixed. It was caused due to a leak that can sometimes occur in &lt;code&gt;happy-dom&lt;/code&gt; if you don't explicitly call &lt;code&gt;DetachedWindowAPI.close&lt;/code&gt; after you are done using a &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;.
- Sponsor information is now powered by OpenCollective.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Sharkey: 2024.9.1</title>
    <updated>2024-11-05T04:16:48+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>TransFem-org/Sharkey</name>

    <content>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new "following" view, inspired by Cohost's "following feed"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when following links to external sites, users are asked for confirmation (users and admins can set lists of destination domains that won't trigger the confirmation dialog, or disable it completely)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;users can turn off cat-speak for all notes they see&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avatar decorations can be placed behind the avatar picture (so it can have a tail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;users can now make in-app notifications clickable in settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capitalized emoji aliases are now properly found in the emoji picker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remote polls' vote counts can be manually refreshed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on the user profile page, we show if they're blocked, muted, followed, &amp;amp;c&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user profiles show their latest notes by default, not their pinned notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;users can see their pending outgoing follow requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;note attachments are navigable via keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;users have a "default files as NSFW" setting, separate from "always mark files as NSFW" (the new one is fully under user control, the other one can be forced by admins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rejecting a new user's sign-up application frees that username for future users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;admin have more control over the maximum text size for notes: they can limit main text, cw, and alt text, separately for local and remote notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moderators can delete all files from a remote instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;local "system accounts" are protected from accidental deletion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;information about remote instances includes following/followers
  relations, and actions that break federation will show how many
  relations will be severed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when an instance is blocked or silenced because it's on a sub-domain
  of a blocked / silenced domain, admins get a clear message about it,
  and the buttons to un-block / un-silence are disabled instead of
  just useless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reports from an instance can be automatically rejected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abuse reports are rendered better in small viewports like phones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abuse reports federate correctly with Akkoma &amp;amp; Pleroma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;welcome page and sidebar can have their own image, instead of
  sharing the instance icon, so an instance can have a big fancy logo
  without having to fork Sharkey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the instance's donation link goes to Open Collective, supporters will
  be shown in the "about" page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights of changes from Misskey:
* dedicated view for notes and timelines to embed on websites
* allow-list federation
* users can set a message to be sent when accepting a follow request
* the list of blocked and silenced instances is now inside the "moderation" section of the admin  control panel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible surprises:
* the client setting "other → experimental features → enable condensed line for acct" finally has an effect: it compresses usernames horizontally instead of truncating them; that setting has been there for several releases, but had next to no effect, so some users may have enabled it and forgot about it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Special upgrade notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When upgrading an existing instance to version 2024.9.1, the Following Feed will initially be empty.
The feed will gradually fill as new posts federate, but it may be desirable to back-fill the feed with existing data.
This database script will populate the feed with the latest post of each type for all users, ensuring that data is fully populated after the update.
Run this after migrations but before starting the instance.
Warning: the script may take a long time to execute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sql
INSERT INTO latest_note (user_id, note_id, is_public, is_reply, is_quote)
SELECT
    "userId" as user_id,
    id as note_id,
    visibility = 'public' AS is_public,
    "replyId" IS NOT NULL AS is_reply,
    (
        "renoteId" IS NOT NULL
            AND (
            text IS NOT NULL
                OR cw IS NOT NULL
                OR "replyId" IS NOT NULL
                OR "hasPoll"
                OR "fileIds" != '{}'
            )
        ) AS is_quote
FROM note
WHERE ( -- Exclude pure renotes (boosts)
                "renoteId" IS NULL
                    OR text IS NOT NULL
                    OR cw IS NOT NULL
                    OR "replyId" IS NOT NULL
                    OR "hasPoll"
                    OR "fileIds" != '{}'
                )
ORDER BY id DESC -- This part is very important: it ensures that we only load the *latest* notes of each type. Do not remove it!
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING; -- Any conflicts are guaranteed to be older notes that we can ignore.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
