    <content>&lt;p&gt;This update tackles quite a few various features that have been asked for quite a bit. Podcast feeds with user and pass now work and can be easily added, the episode layout page can now handle podcast additions and removals much more gracefully, and you can now manually refresh podcasts! There's a button right on the home screen to quickly run a refresh. Plenty of additional fixes and cleanups have been completed in addition. Features are starting to slow somewhat as I start do everything I can to ensure a really polished experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with Podcasts page not refreshing correctly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Added Add Custom Feed to Podcasts page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Allow for podcast feeds with user and pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Add option to add podcast from feed on podcasts page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Ensure podcast loads onto podcast page when adding a new custom one in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Adjusted buttons on episode layout page so they dynamically adjust position to fit better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Option for user to manually update feeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Update Feed directly after adding a Nextcloud/gpodder sync server instead of waiting for the next refresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with episode refreshing where a panic could occur (This was due to the categories list)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Ensured See More Button only shows when needed (Just made the descriptions clickable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with context for podcasts not dynamically updating on the episode layout page once the podcast was added to the db&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with nextcloud sync on mysql dbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with db setup with mysql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Ensured deleting podcast when on the episode layout page it closes the deleted modal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;There's plenty to take in and discover with this new update. I highly recommend installing this new version and giving it a go! So much has been changed and updated.

&lt;li&gt;[x] Update queue slider to be centered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] People don't clear out of hosts and people dropdowns if a podcast doesn't have people. So it shows the old podcast currently&lt;/li&gt;
