&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Future major versions of Snipe-IT will requires PHP 8.2.0 or greater. Please update as soon as possible to avoid delays updating Snipe-IT moving forward!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="liz-lemon-wednesday" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59e484d8-8245-4827-adc0-e5fd24949fd5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Wednesday, Grokstars! This release adds several small quality of life improvements on both mobile and desktop view, as well as some refactoring to make sure we have tests and a smoother transition as we begin focusing on Snipe-IT v8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added saved custom report templates, so if you find yourself running different custom asset reports frequently, you can now save them instead of adding filter criteria each time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!NOTE]&lt;br /&gt;
If you end up seeing some blank table lists, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear your cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your .env changing &lt;code&gt;BS_TABLE_STORAGE=cookieStorage&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;BS_TABLE_STORAGE=localStorage&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear your config cache (if you use it): &lt;code&gt;php artisan config:clear&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're encouraging everyone to switch to &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; for that value, as folks with a lot of custom fields, etc can end up stuffing the browser cookie full and getting errors, whereas &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; can hold a lot more info. (The &lt;code&gt;BS_TABLE_STORAGE&lt;/code&gt; env var determines whether it's cookies or local storage that holds your sorting, pagination, search, etc preferences within the table.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, future major releases of Snipe-IT will require PHP version 8.2.0 or greater, so get those servers upgraded!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.1.17</title>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The next version of Snipe-IT will requires PHP 8.2.0 or greater. Please update as soon as possible to avoid delays updating Snipe-IT moving forward!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday! This is the final Snipe-IT release in the v7.x line. Snipe-IT v8 will be out very soon, so please make sure you've updated your PHP version to 8.2 or greater to prepare for the upcoming release! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="02xmFoi" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1988179d-2e33-43e4-9a5a-72bd655141a2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release handles a few small issues related to QR codes and adds notes to locations, companies, categories, manufacturers and permission groups. It also fixes an issue where the the number of assets on some tabs was mismatched if the "show archived in lists" box was unchecked, and should fix a misformatted API response that could have impacted Jamf2Snipe and Kandji2Snipe. (That was fixed a few weeks ago, but was not in a tagged release.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this changelog looks a little small, bear in mind that we've been busting our butts on the &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branch to get Snipe-IT v8 ready. That's set to release later today, and will have a few more goodies for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed potential attempt to divide by zero in transformer by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16116&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevent undefined array key in asset observer by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16118&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Nullsafe  by @spencerrlongg in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16148&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed default ternary check in Label view by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16166&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a warning for  webhook &lt;code&gt;channel_not_found&lt;/code&gt;. by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16175&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added ternary check that asset has &lt;code&gt;asset status&lt;/code&gt; before checking archived by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16168&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added qr code type check in getQRCode method by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16167&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgraded papaparse to 5.5.1 by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16207&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #16208 - don't call preg_split() with a null by @uberbrady in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16209&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added ternaries on check in/out hardware notifications by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16212&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #16184 - added notes to locations, companies, categories, manufacturers and groups by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16226&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expiration notifcation switched to use Mailable by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16232&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return flat JSON instead of transformed data by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16249&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of saving TLS cache-files on save, cache them when used by @uberbrady in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16250&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed QR code on old label engine by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16260&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;lastname.firstinitial&lt;/code&gt; as an option for usernames by @akemidx in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16199&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #16259 - mismatch in asset count if archived assets are hidden by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16268&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope API results by location ID by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16269&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated LDAP sync text by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16270&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added translations to LDAP  and Label settings pages by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16188&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a null check to label templates, adds return types for validation methods by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16040&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Changelog&lt;/strong&gt;: https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/compare/v7.1.16...v7.1.17&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v8.0.0</title>

    <content>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday (again!) We're thrilled to release v8 of Snipe-IT! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="felicia-yay" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7765a4ac-2273-4c33-b249-009e2d35770e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We released the final version in the v7 line earlier today (7.1.17) so that folks who for some reason can't upgrade PHP to 8.2+ would still have a final release to use, but of course, we encourage everyone to bring their PHP versions into LTS compliance. If you skipped that upgrade (understandably, since it was just released today), you can see the other changelog here: https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/compare/v7.1.16...v8.0.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!NOTE]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If you run into an issue with blank tables on some screens, please see the pinned issue #16136 for the fix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Here's the highlight reel:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom fields on checkin/checkout! (Documentation updates coming shortly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breadcrumbs for better UX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better tooltips to explain icons on very tab-dense screens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now add arbitrary notes to assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Oromo (Ethiopian) as a language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saved custom report templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings our version of Laravel (the framework we use) and the PHP dependencies into LTS (Laravel 11 is in LTS for another year and PHP 8.2's security support is for another two years.) We'll be yanking Snipe-IT into v12 of Laravel soon, but the system requirements won't change, so you won't have to worry about that as long as you're on PHP 8.2 or better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also really pretty excited about the UX improvements - we hope they make your life easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big thanks to &lt;strong&gt;asnyder&lt;/strong&gt; from the MacAdmins slack for some early testing work, and as always, huge thanks @swift2512 for their relentless pursuit of a better UX. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small update should resolve issues folks had with the upgrader failing on backup due to &lt;code&gt;composer install&lt;/code&gt; not having run yet, and a few 500 errors that were occurring due to some changes we made with the way Laravel handles route-model binding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're just getting around to upgrading from the v7.x line, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/releases/tag/v8.0.0"&gt;full v8 release notes&lt;/a&gt; are a little more exciting. :) We have a blog post up with a little more context for the v8 changes &lt;a href="https://grokstar.dev/news/snipeit-releases/2025/02/announcing-snipe-it-v8/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v8.0.2</title>
    <updated>2025-02-27T07:30:36-05:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howdy all! Just a small point release today to handle some tiny issues we've seen since the 8.0.0 release. We've also improved the look of the upgrader script to give you color support to make things a little clearer if something went wrong with your upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also changed the behavior of what happens when you edit an asset to a pending status. Previously, editing an asset to a non-deployable asset status would automatically check it in. Now, both deployable and pending status types will stay checked in (if they are checked out) and only &lt;em&gt;archived&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;undeployable&lt;/em&gt; will automatically checkin assets. This is to account for use-cases like when an asset it out for repair should still technically be assigned to the user in question, as it will be returned once it comes back from repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!NOTE]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Please make sure you have changed your &lt;code&gt;BS_TABLE_STORAGE&lt;/code&gt; value to &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; and clear your cookies after upgrading. See the pinned issue #16136 for additional information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #16173: &lt;code&gt;useraccountcontrol&lt;/code&gt; was not included in the ldap query attributes by @joakimbergros in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16337&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #16331 - Don't make passport:install command require user input by @uberbrady in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16341&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed renaming custom fields by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16345&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;model_number&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;notes&lt;/code&gt; for stricter asset model API search by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16356&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;--no-interaction&lt;/code&gt; to additional passport commands by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16363&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add safety around bulk status update by @spencerrlongg in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16360&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed acceptance reminder command lag on users with no associated email by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16361&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow pending as an asset status type that does not automatically check the asset in by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16354&lt;/li&gt;
