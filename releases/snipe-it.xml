    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.0.13</title>
    <updated>2024-10-02T07:56:02-04:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snipe-IT now requires PHP 8.1.2 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="liz-lemon-wednesday" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59e484d8-8245-4827-adc0-e5fd24949fd5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Wednesday, everyone! We're pleased to announce Snipe-IT v7.13 is out. The most notable fix in this release is for folks who suddenly couldn't create asset models with the same name but different model number. That was a temporary issue in validation and should be fixed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added the long-requested ability to sort numerically on numeric custom fields. (Folks who are not using MySQL/MariaDB, please let us know if this breaks stuff for you, even though we don't officially support non-MySQL databases.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added a new bulk option for users, which is the ability to print all items associated with multiple selected users, if that's the sort of thing you're likely to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, on most list views, you can now see (and sort by) which administrator created the item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;API Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've added a &lt;code&gt;created_by&lt;/code&gt; field to additional endpoints. This field replaces the previous &lt;code&gt;user_id&lt;/code&gt; API object,  which was only being returned in a few places. The &lt;code&gt;user_id&lt;/code&gt; object will still be returned as normal, but you should plan on making that switch in your API integrations moving forward, as it will eventually be removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a couple bugs in &lt;code&gt;CustomFieldSetDefaultValuesForModel&lt;/code&gt; component by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15486&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fixes margin for the sidebar menus while using rtl languages by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15471&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed check for outside assets on user update validation by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15516&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added tests for delete methods in api by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15512&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.1.14 - Security Release</title>
    <updated>2024-11-13T19:19:43-05:00</updated>
    <author>

    <content>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]
 &lt;strong&gt;This is a security release. All Snipe-IT users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]
 &lt;strong&gt;FYI, in our excitement to get this released, we mistakenly tagged this as 7.1.14 instead of 7.0.14 (yay, automation, amirite?) Unfortunately, deleting tags makes this more difficult for our docker users, so we're just running with it.&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry for the confusion, but you didn't miss anything, it was just a simple typo. We'll update the version.php file so at least they both agree. There are no new server requirements or libraries required outside of the standard 7.x.x requirements to handle this upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="liz-lemon-wednesday" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59e484d8-8245-4827-adc0-e5fd24949fd5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to be getting a lot of mileage from that gif these days. ðŸ« &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a security release that handles several CVEs, including &lt;a href="https://www.securityhive.io/blog/understanding-cve-2024-52301-why-you-must-upgrade-your-laravel-application"&gt;CVE-2024-52301&lt;/a&gt;, which was just patched in the Laravel core yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While hosted customers were NOT affected (we do not have &lt;code&gt;register_argc_argv&lt;/code&gt; enabled on any of our servers), self-hosted community users and support-only customers are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, or at the very least &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php"&gt;make sure that setting is not enabled&lt;/a&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;php.ini&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the security patches, we have also added some new features, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to import Asset Models (without accompanying assets) via the Importer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to override or null out the EOL date for assets via the asset bulk edit screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimized some queries and indexes to speed things up a bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug where OU was accidentally required to create locations via the GUI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miscellaneous UI improvements and fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full changelog can be found below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, still lots more on deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS - we will likely be discontinuing posting updates on our Twitter account moving forward. Instead, find us in these other places:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.1.16</title>
    <updated>2025-01-22T13:02:51-05:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Future major versions of Snipe-IT will requires PHP 8.2.0 or greater. Please update as soon as possible to avoid delays updating Snipe-IT moving forward!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="liz-lemon-wednesday" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59e484d8-8245-4827-adc0-e5fd24949fd5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Wednesday, Grokstars! This release adds several small quality of life improvements on both mobile and desktop view, as well as some refactoring to make sure we have tests and a smoother transition as we begin focusing on Snipe-IT v8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added saved custom report templates, so if you find yourself running different custom asset reports frequently, you can now save them instead of adding filter criteria each time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!NOTE]&lt;br /&gt;
If you end up seeing some blank table lists, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear your cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your .env changing &lt;code&gt;BS_TABLE_STORAGE=cookieStorage&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;BS_TABLE_STORAGE=localStorage&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear your config cache (if you use it): &lt;code&gt;php artisan config:clear&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're encouraging everyone to switch to &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; for that value, as folks with a lot of custom fields, etc can end up stuffing the browser cookie full and getting errors, whereas &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; can hold a lot more info. (The &lt;code&gt;BS_TABLE_STORAGE&lt;/code&gt; env var determines whether it's cookies or local storage that holds your sorting, pagination, search, etc preferences within the table.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, future major releases of Snipe-IT will require PHP version 8.2.0 or greater, so get those servers upgraded!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed Users API &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; from clearing &lt;code&gt;location_id&lt;/code&gt; unnecessarily by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15889&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use transformer for model files by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16101&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile view fix by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15890&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardened asset checkout validation by requiring integer by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15892&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #15901 - re-added required indicator on text and select custom fields by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15904&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revert "Hardened asset checkout validation by requiring integer" by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15908&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Included &lt;code&gt;MAIL_FROM_ADDR&lt;/code&gt; in phpunit configuration by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15910&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;MAIL_FROM_NAME&lt;/code&gt; to mail envelope by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15918&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fixed Vague Error Messages In Setting Asset Model Default Values by @spencerrlongg in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15565&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only update asset locations to assets checked out to users. [Fixes: fd-45583 and fd-45702] by @uberbrady in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15939&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed Unaccepted Assets Reports Resend acceptance reminder email function by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15914&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added null safe operator to accepter reminder command by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15954&lt;/li&gt;
