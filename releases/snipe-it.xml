&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Tuesday! Hopefully everyone's power is back up and running after Europe's big power outage yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, we've got a new address! We moved the Snipe-IT repo from &lt;code&gt;snipe/snipe-it&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;grokability/snipe-it&lt;/code&gt;. You can &lt;a href="https://grokstar.dev/news/2025/04/were-moving-from-snipe-snipe-it-to-grokability-snipe-it/"&gt;read a little more about that on our blog&lt;/a&gt;, but the short version is that everything went smoothly, existing PRs and issues were moved, and redirects from the old repo address to the new digs should be automatic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have file uploads for locations, the ability scope locations to company, the ability to seed common manufacturers, locations as a QR code destination, and we added the ability to add custom fields to audit screens (and a bunch more stuff detailed below.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release also fixes a ton of bugs, adds more accessibility controls, and addresses some additional security controls around printable lists of items and a vulnerability in Laravel File Validation. &lt;strong&gt;As this is a security release, we strongly recommend upgrading as soon as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="fixing-bugs" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6936479-0575-4c4e-8773-fc73ecfae10f" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday! This tagged release should hopefully fix the docker builds that were not auto-pushing since the repo move. (We're still trying to find a way to get back to the old location where our 10M docker pulls and stars more accurately reflect reality, but Docker Hub doesn't make that particularly easy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know the docker builds are running very slow right now, and we're working on speeding those up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed updating CONTRIBUTORS.md via cli by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16829&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #16834 - better handle bad data in permissions by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16836&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small improvements to scoped views by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16837&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworked fix for for 24mm_D label indent errror by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16826&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed purchase cost column always shown by @akemidx in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16531&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy changes from 'master' to develop for docker builds by @uberbrady in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16840&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed duplicate input-group color corrections from theme skins by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16841&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Changelog&lt;/strong&gt;: https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/compare/v8.1.1...v8.1.2&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v8.1.3</title>
    <updated>2025-05-07T07:09:21-04:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>grokability/snipe-it</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Wednesday! This release fixes a few small bugs, updates a library dependency that had a CVE, and &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt; handles some of our docker users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're sorry this has been a hassle for the docker folks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dockerhub makes it surprisingly un-intuitive to keep your Dockerhub namespace when you switch a GH repo namespace. Why would we want to keep our old Dockerhub namespace, you ask? Good question! Turns out you can't move namespaces and keep your stars and pull counts, which we kinda want, since we're the original creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to undo some of the much faster build optimizations we had previously made for Docker people - they take almost an &lt;em&gt;hour&lt;/em&gt; now - ouch. But we'll be revisiting that and speeding it back up in the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify, Docker folks should be pulling from &lt;code&gt;snipe/snipe-it&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;grokability/snipe-it&lt;/code&gt;. It's counter-intuitive, I know. Dockerhub won't let us move without losing literally a decade of pull and star stats. :( &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Livewire component for smoother check for location companies by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16860&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set upload-limit by @chfsx in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16806&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds Label fields offset as an option by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16790&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add barcode support for Avery 3490 by @realchrisolin in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16847&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #15629 - prevent setting &lt;code&gt;assigned_to&lt;/code&gt; without setting assigned_type by @uberbrady in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/15907&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix dockerhub repo we're pushing to, and arm build names by @jerm in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16851&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added missing contributors by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16864&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #16815: Avoids potential error when settings table is empty by @ntaylor-86 in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16865&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More dockerhub repo references by @jerm in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16868&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One more docker repo name fix by @jerm in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16871&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redirect options on audit by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16873&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed breadcrumbs for cloning by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16874&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes CVE-2025-46734: league/commonmark contains a XSS vulnerability in Attributes extension  by @joelpittet in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16875&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move back to multiarch builds with emulation (for now) by @jerm in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16876&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@chfsx made their first contribution in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16806&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@realchrisolin made their first contribution in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16847&lt;/li&gt;
