    <content>&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday, everyone! This is a bugfix release, mostly for folks running docker who only can deploy via tagged releases. We also fixed an issue with asset models not displaying on the listing page in some circumstances, fixed a few issues related to the recent MS Teams webhook deprecations, and handled an issue where uploaded asset files could not be deleted properly, plus a few visual tweaks for the signature pad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Specify the table name in select for models controller by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15811&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Removes asset tag if 2D code is not present by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15817&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.1.16</title>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Future major versions of Snipe-IT will requires PHP 8.2.0 or greater. Please update as soon as possible to avoid delays updating Snipe-IT moving forward!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="liz-lemon-wednesday" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59e484d8-8245-4827-adc0-e5fd24949fd5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Wednesday, Grokstars! This release adds several small quality of life improvements on both mobile and desktop view, as well as some refactoring to make sure we have tests and a smoother transition as we begin focusing on Snipe-IT v8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added saved custom report templates, so if you find yourself running different custom asset reports frequently, you can now save them instead of adding filter criteria each time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!NOTE]&lt;br /&gt;
If you end up seeing some blank table lists, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear your cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your .env changing &lt;code&gt;BS_TABLE_STORAGE=cookieStorage&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;BS_TABLE_STORAGE=localStorage&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear your config cache (if you use it): &lt;code&gt;php artisan config:clear&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're encouraging everyone to switch to &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; for that value, as folks with a lot of custom fields, etc can end up stuffing the browser cookie full and getting errors, whereas &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; can hold a lot more info. (The &lt;code&gt;BS_TABLE_STORAGE&lt;/code&gt; env var determines whether it's cookies or local storage that holds your sorting, pagination, search, etc preferences within the table.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, future major releases of Snipe-IT will require PHP version 8.2.0 or greater, so get those servers upgraded!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed Users API &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; from clearing &lt;code&gt;location_id&lt;/code&gt; unnecessarily by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15889&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use transformer for model files by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16101&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile view fix by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15890&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardened asset checkout validation by requiring integer by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15892&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #15901 - re-added required indicator on text and select custom fields by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15904&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revert "Hardened asset checkout validation by requiring integer" by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15908&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Included &lt;code&gt;MAIL_FROM_ADDR&lt;/code&gt; in phpunit configuration by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15910&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.1.17</title>
    <updated>2025-02-24T06:28:00-05:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The next version of Snipe-IT will requires PHP 8.2.0 or greater. Please update as soon as possible to avoid delays updating Snipe-IT moving forward!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday! This is the final Snipe-IT release in the v7.x line. Snipe-IT v8 will be out very soon, so please make sure you've updated your PHP version to 8.2 or greater to prepare for the upcoming release! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="02xmFoi" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1988179d-2e33-43e4-9a5a-72bd655141a2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release handles a few small issues related to QR codes and adds notes to locations, companies, categories, manufacturers and permission groups. It also fixes an issue where the the number of assets on some tabs was mismatched if the "show archived in lists" box was unchecked, and should fix a misformatted API response that could have impacted Jamf2Snipe and Kandji2Snipe. (That was fixed a few weeks ago, but was not in a tagged release.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this changelog looks a little small, bear in mind that we've been busting our butts on the &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branch to get Snipe-IT v8 ready. That's set to release later today, and will have a few more goodies for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v8.0.0</title>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday (again!) We're thrilled to release v8 of Snipe-IT! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="felicia-yay" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7765a4ac-2273-4c33-b249-009e2d35770e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We released the final version in the v7 line earlier today (7.1.17) so that folks who for some reason can't upgrade PHP to 8.2+ would still have a final release to use, but of course, we encourage everyone to bring their PHP versions into LTS compliance. If you skipped that upgrade (understandably, since it was just released today), you can see the other changelog here: https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/compare/v7.1.16...v8.0.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Here's the highlight reel:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom fields on checkin/checkout! (Documentation updates coming shortly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breadcrumbs for better UX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better tooltips to explain icons on very tab-dense screens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now add arbitrary notes to assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Oromo (Ethiopian) as a language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings our version of Laravel (the framework we use) and the PHP dependencies into LTS (Laravel 11 is in LTS for another year and PHP 8.2's security support is for another two years.) We'll be yanking Snipe-IT into v12 of Laravel soon, but the system requirements won't change, so you won't have to worry about that as long as you're on PHP 8.2 or better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also really pretty excited about the UX improvements - we hope they make your life easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big thanks to &lt;strong&gt;asnyder&lt;/strong&gt; from the MacAdmins slack for some early testing work, and as always, huge thanks @swift2512 for their relentless pursuit of a better UX. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small update should resolve issues folks had with the upgrader failing on backup due to &lt;code&gt;composer install&lt;/code&gt; not having run yet, and a few 500 errors that were occurring due to some changes we made with the way Laravel handles route-model binding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're just getting around to upgrading from the v7.x line, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/releases/tag/v8.0.0"&gt;full v8 release notes&lt;/a&gt; are a little more exciting. :) We have a blog post up with a little more context for the v8 changes &lt;a href="https://grokstar.dev/news/snipeit-releases/2025/02/announcing-snipe-it-v8/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed 500 on edit locations page by referencing current location by @jostrander in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16320&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed references to mcrypt by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16062&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Changed parameter name for route-model binding by @spencerrlongg in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16321&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove remaining hardware references in favor of new RMB by @spencerrlongg in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16325&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added label test by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16335&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #16334 - Changed composer order in upgrade script by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/16336&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
