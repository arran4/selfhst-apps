    <content>&lt;p&gt;New Features &amp;amp; Enhancements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Nonintrusive Corner Tabs &amp;amp; Expansions:
    - Small triangular tabs appear in the bottom corners of the page.
    - Clicking a tab reveals an animated, quarter-circle expansion:
        The left tab shows project information (name, author, and version).
        The right tab opens a large, clickable GitHub icon linking to the project page.
   -  These tabs are fully integrated into the layout without interfering with text sharing functionality.

Improved Dark/Light Mode Toggle:
    - Positioned at the bottom center of the page, the toggle matches the modernized design.
    - Fully responsive, with animations to improve user experience.

WebSocket Connection Handling:
    - If the WebSocket connection is lost, the page becomes read-only and displays a clear error message.
    - Users can click a "Reload Page" link to reconnect.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Ghostboard: MARKDOWN EDITING!</title>
    <updated>2025-02-01T13:34:24-05:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This was an awesome suggestion from /u/jack3308 over on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could I be SUPER selfish and ask if you have plans to provide support for markdown in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) implementation? This would so quickly become my most used self hosted service if it did!!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes you can. The markdown editor turned out better than I had hoped. The regular ole text editor is still present, but there is now a switch at the bottom next to the dark mode switch. You can go between light mode and dark mode. The text remains the same and regardless of how you type it or how you interact with it, will always sync up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Ghostboard: SIMPLIFIED PORTS</title>
    <updated>2025-02-02T19:24:16-05:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;I think a common issue preventing folks from using this was the fact that a websocket and webserver port are both required, it made reverse proxies more challenging than they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this release, I included nginx and if accessed through port 80 (internal ofc), all traffic will travel through that port. The container's nginx and the program will identify that they are behind nginx and use a /ws endpoint on port 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I did not want to introduce a breaking change, and so, you can continue to expose ports 8080 and 8765 if they are set up and working. They will continue to work in the way that they have. They will see that they are not behind nginx and not rely on the /ws endpoint, instead accessing the necessary ports directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this hopefully does not introduce a breaking change, but let me know if it does.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Ghostboard: Visual Style Improvements</title>
    <updated>2025-02-04T12:20:55-05:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly small release with not much change, but it addresses a few annoying visual issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previously, when scrolling down on a lot of text either in markdown mode or in text mode, the switches at the bottom of the page would get in the way and make it more difficult to access buttons at the bottom of the text box. That has been fixed and now the scrolling will continue until the buttons are above the bottom switches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The drag and drop green outline wasn't consistent across text mode, markdown-edit mode, and markdown-preview mode. It may not be perfect, but it's much better now than it had been. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content>
