    <content>&lt;h1&gt;Major Changes For 0.13.0&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Advisories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://securitylab.github.com/"&gt;Github Security Lab&lt;/a&gt; team reached out to report the following security vulnerabilities.
- &lt;a href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-xq49-hv88-jr6h"&gt;Cross-site request forgery in &lt;code&gt;config_save&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;config_set&lt;/code&gt; request handlers (GHSL-2023-198)&lt;/a&gt;
- &lt;a href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-jjxc-m35j-p56f"&gt;Reflected XSS through &lt;code&gt;/&amp;lt;camera_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; API endpoints (GHSL-2023-195)&lt;/a&gt;
- &lt;a href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-qp3h-4q62-p428"&gt;Unsafe deserialization in &lt;code&gt;load_config_with_no_duplicates&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;frigate/util/builtin.py&lt;/code&gt; (GHSL-2023-190)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploiting these vulnerabilities requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with some authentication methods implemented)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacker knows the public address of a user's Frigate instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't click any links to your Frigate server from unknown sources, there is no reason to believe that you have been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have enabled the private vulnerability disclosure features inside Github for the project as well as the automated CodeQL scanning features to identify future issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breaking Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ARM 32-bit support has officially been removed. If you are running on a Raspberry Pi with a 32-bit OS, you will need to switch to 64-bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will likely experience some additional CPU usage because motion detection is now more sensitive and &lt;code&gt;improve_contrast&lt;/code&gt; is now enabled by default. If you have specific values set in your config, it is recommended to remove them and &lt;a href="https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/motion_detection"&gt;re-calibrate as necessary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no detect resolution is defined then frigate will now run detect at the native camera resolution. This means if you did not explicitly set the detect width / height AND your sub stream is not 1280x720, then your masks and zones will be configured incorrectly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stationary object validation is now required, anyone who manually set &lt;code&gt;interval: 0&lt;/code&gt; will need to delete this field from the config or increase the value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes have been made to the DB schema, downgrading to 0.12 will require restoring from a backup or deleting the DB and existing recordings / snapshots.
NOTE: Some users have reported migrations taking a while and frigate frontend is not available until the migrations are complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New location for &lt;code&gt;frigate.db&lt;/code&gt;: Due to the support for network shares in HA OS and the popularity of storing recordings on a NAS in general, the database has a new default location of &lt;code&gt;/config/frigate.db&lt;/code&gt;. This change is going to be done for existing users too, so frigate will automatically move the db for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Frigate Addon Users&lt;/strong&gt;:
    The migration is handled automatically and no action is required from the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Docker Container Users&lt;/strong&gt;:
    The migration is handled for you, but you must make sure that the docker CLI or docker-compose binds the entire &lt;code&gt;/config&lt;/code&gt; directory and not just the &lt;code&gt;/config/config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if your current volume mapping is &lt;code&gt;- /host/path/config_folder/config.yml:/config/config.yml&lt;/code&gt; it should now be &lt;code&gt;- /host/path/config_folder/:/config/&lt;/code&gt;
- The previously deprecated &lt;code&gt;record -&amp;gt; retain_days&lt;/code&gt; config has been removed, this should be migrated to &lt;code&gt;record -&amp;gt; retain -&amp;gt; days&lt;/code&gt; if you have not already.
- HomeAssistant &lt;a href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration/releases/tag/v5.0.0"&gt;Integration 5.0&lt;/a&gt; is required for the new features introduced in this release.
- TensorRT has been updated and the model generation has been refactored. New models will need to be generated for 0.13 and have a new path, check the detector docs for more info.
- TensorRT now requires Nvidia Driver Version 530+
- The cameras in &lt;code&gt;/stats&lt;/code&gt; have been moved to their own &lt;code&gt;cameras&lt;/code&gt; block. This only affects users that were directly reading from the &lt;code&gt;/stats&lt;/code&gt; data via the API or MQTT. 
- Removed direct access to the go2rtc http API to mitigate potential remote code execution via the exec source, you will need to map port 1984 and access directly if using go2rtc http api outside of frigate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frigate+&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Frigate+ Model Launch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate+ models are now rolling out by invitation. If you would like to be invited for early access to purchase a subscription, please send an email to blake@frigate.video from the email address on your Frigate+ account. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/discussions/7932"&gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;False positive submissions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now submit false positive detections to Frigate+ for training feedback. Note that you will still need to login to your Frigate+ account and verify the images to ensure all relevant objects are labeled before the image will be used during training. Confirming the object is a true positive will also upload the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/569905/233863279-e9567eef-0192-4cb1-993c-23b618c854ba.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release has support for Frigate+ models. The model and related information are stored at &lt;code&gt;/config/model_cache&lt;/code&gt;. Once Frigate+ models are launched, you will be able to use the model id in your config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;yaml
model:
  path: plus://your_model_id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community Supported Boards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In version 0.12 Frigate gained support for Intel iGPUs via OpenVINO and for Nvidia GPUs, this was a great step forward for compatibility and for more users being able to use Frigate effectively. There are many other devices, including dedicated SBCs (Small Board Computers), that Frigate could support but the maintainers do not have the time or hardware to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community supported boards framework will allow community members who want to contribute to create and manage support for a particular board. This will allow Frigate to support more devices while allowing the maintainers to focus on improving the core of Frigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nvidia Jetson Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@madsciencetist has contributed a community supported board build by adding support for Jetson 4.6 and Jetson 5 devices!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information can be found in the detector docs on how to set this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/object_detectors#nvidia-tensorrt-detector&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@MarcA711 has contributed a community supported board build by adding support for devices with RockChip SoCs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RK3566/RK3568
RK3588/RK3588S
RV1103/RV1106
RK3562&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/object_detectors#rockchip-rknn-toolkit-lite2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Object Tracking &amp;amp; Motion Detection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been many improvements to object tracking and motion detection which make Frigate more efficient and can reduce false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Object Tracker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate now uses Norfair for object tracking, this means that object attributes like size, width/height ratio, and position are used to intelligently track objects. ID swapping between tracked objects is greatly reduced in situations where a car in the driveway was confused with a car passing in the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improved Motion Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate's motion detection is now more efficient. Motion detection will also re-calibrate for flashes like lightning or when the camera switches from color to IR mode or it is moved via PTZ. This reduces CPU usage during these changes and reduces false positives caused by excessive motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Historical Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate now uses the recordings timeline data to generate an 8x8 grid for each camera. This grid holds the range of expected regions (portions of the image sent to detection) for that area of the camera frame. This helps to improve accuracy of detection after motion has occurred and can reduce false positives in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grid is updated on each startup and every day at 2 AM for each camera that is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Minimum Time For Zone Presence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate now has a configurable field for the minimum amount of time an object needs to be in a zone before it is considered in a zone. For example, currently in Frigate if you have a front_yard zone and someone is walking by and briefly steps into the front yard Frigate would create an event for this. However, you may prefer for events to only be created if a person is in the front yard for multiple frames before creating an event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;yaml
zones:
  my_zone:
    inertia: 3  # &amp;lt;- 3 consecutive frames needed to consider object in zone
    coordinates: ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recordings Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of improvements to the management of recordings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recordings Exporting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate now supports exporting recordings in standard format or as a time-lapse. Exported recordings are stored in &lt;code&gt;/media/frigate/exports&lt;/code&gt; and are downloadable from the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-15 at 07 38 26 AM" src="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/assets/14866235/d0d4a5a7-b97f-448d-a938-31f40c805968" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recordings Timeline Metadata&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate now saves metadata for key moments in an event such as when the tracked object is detected, enters or exits zone, becomes active / stationary, and leaves. This metadata is used to overlay on top of the recordings so it is easy to see what was detected and where. Note that the timing of the bounding boxes will likely be slightly off because it is based on the detect stream, but overlayed on the record stream. The &lt;code&gt;annotation_offset&lt;/code&gt; value in the config can be used to adjust for any differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-27 at 05 41 33 AM" src="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/assets/14866235/cb79ba77-e4b6-4496-a8e7-dc04b754c895" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Internal Processing Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been many improvements to the recordings management process to make it faster and more efficient:
- Recordings maintainer now lives in a dedicated process
- Recordings maintenance is now fully asynchronous
- Database writes are now much more efficient
- Record config can now have &lt;code&gt;sync_recordings&lt;/code&gt; enabled which will check all recordings in the db and on the file to make sure they are in sync and recordings sync will be run once a day on the last 36 hours of recordings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audio Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate now supports audio events via YamNet. Over 600 labels are included so there are too many to list here, but Frigate can listen to a cameras audio feed to create events and update MQTT when speech, yell, fire alarm, dog bark, etc. are heard. &lt;a href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration/releases/tag/v5.0.0"&gt;Version 5.0 of the HomeAssistant integration&lt;/a&gt; also supports sensors for these audio detections so automations can be fired when certain types of audio are detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-27 at 06 13 34 AM" src="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/assets/14866235/0a487d65-53f4-4eaa-a6fe-56a8b688a333" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manual Events API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate now supports creating events manually via the API. This means that custom events can be created, for example an event when the doorbell is pressed or a sensor is tripped. The API allows full control of event length, if recordings should be saved, and much more. The request and response can be seen in the &lt;a href="https://docs.frigate.video/integrations/api#post-apieventscamera_namelabelcreate"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curl Example:
&lt;code&gt;shell
curl -X POST "http://&amp;lt;frigate_ip&amp;gt;:5000/api/events/front_doorbell_cam/doorbell/create" -H Content-Type:\ application/json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PTZ Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate now supports PTZ cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Basic PTZ Autotracking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="autotrack" src="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/dev/docs/static/img/frigate-autotracking-example.gif?raw=true" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="autotrack_debug" src="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/dev/docs/static/img/autotracking-debug.gif?raw=true" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/autotracking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Frigate's improved tracking algorithm, basic autotracking is now supported. Not all PTZ cameras will support this as relative movement is required (see the docs for more details).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PTZ Controls In The WebUI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate also supports controlling PTZ cameras in the WebUI and via the Home Assistant Integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 07 06 21 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14866235/217552681-080b4ad6-157a-4d46-8d92-87b0b1978d3e.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Notable Changes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSE is now supported on iPhones running iOS 17.1+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The events page has been updated to show the ongoing events at the top and past events below. The ongoing events section can be collapsed at any point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ordering of birdseye cameras is now supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birdseye now supports autolayout meaning that a grid system is no longer used. Panoramic and portrait cameras now take up a proportional amount of space to better use the canvas to show these cameras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera zone &amp;amp; mask editor now supports saving directly without the need to copy / paste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deepstack/CodeProjectAI is now supported as a detector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/frigate:0.13.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/frigate:0.13.0-standard-arm64&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/frigate:0.13.0-tensorrt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/frigate:0.13.0-tensorrt-jp4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/frigate:0.13.0-tensorrt-jp5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/frigate:0.13.0-rk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changes since RC2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Major Changes for 0.14.0&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breaking Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several breaking changes in this release, Frigate will attempt to update the configuration automatically. In some cases manual changes may be required. It is always recommended to &lt;strong&gt;backup your current config and database&lt;/strong&gt; before upgrading:
- Simply copy your current config file to a new location
- Stop Frigate and make a copy of the &lt;code&gt;frigate.db&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your existing events will not be visible in Frigate's new UI&lt;/strong&gt;
- An entirely new way of reviewing camera footage has been implemented in Frigate 0.14, and existing events could not be migrated
- Recordings can still be viewed in the new UI using the recordings viewer (From Live view, click/tap on a camera and select the &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt; button at the top left)
- You may want to export any starred/favorite events before upgrading
- If you are using the Home Assistant integration, events can still be viewed there
- Recording (&lt;code&gt;enabled: True&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;record&lt;/code&gt; in your config) is required to see review items and motion data in the UI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone/mask coordinates are now stored in the config as relative values&lt;/strong&gt;
- Frigate's configuration migrator will read your existing mask/zone coordinates and convert them for relative use internally on startup
- Using the built-in mask/zone editor will make your config file incompatible with prior versions of Frigate
- If you have mask/zone coordinate values that exceed the detect resolution, it will be ignored and you will see warnings in the log. Delete the mask or zone from your config and then use the editor in the UI to recreate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UI's live mode is now intelligently selected&lt;/strong&gt;
- The &lt;code&gt;live_mode&lt;/code&gt; config option is now deprecated and should be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backwards incompatible database changes&lt;/strong&gt;
- There are a number of changes made to Frigate's database, which are not backwards compatible. A backup of the database is automatically made on startup, but &lt;strong&gt;a manual backup is highly recommended&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other breaking changes&lt;/strong&gt;
- RTMP was deprecated in 0.13 and has been fully removed in 0.14. You will need to remove any &lt;code&gt;rtmp&lt;/code&gt; references in your config file.
- OpenVINO has been upgraded, and Intel Neural Compute sticks are no longer supported. Support for YOLO-NAS models has been added. Additionally, &lt;code&gt;AUTO&lt;/code&gt; mode now maps to &lt;code&gt;GPU&lt;/code&gt; internally to avoid some unresolved issues with &lt;code&gt;AUTO&lt;/code&gt;. The existing &lt;code&gt;YOLO-X&lt;/code&gt; model will not work in this version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brand New UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate 0.14's UI has been completely rewritten (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJa3dNEO5qQ"&gt;helpful walkthrough video from a user&lt;/a&gt;) and optimized for desktop and mobile devices, aiming to simplify the user experience by focusing on two specific goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow you to quickly see what's currently happening or what just happened on your cameras&lt;/strong&gt;. The new Live view features a real-time dashboard with live camera feeds and a filmstrip of animated thumbnails showing recent activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make reviewing video footage more efficient&lt;/strong&gt;. Frigate intelligently identifies parts of your timeline for review by leveraging the underlying data about motion and tracked objects. The new Review area implements a scrollable grid of thumbnails alongside a timeline where a hover or swipe begins a preview playback. Review items can be configured to be pre-categorized into &lt;em&gt;alerts&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;detections&lt;/em&gt; based on cameras and/or zones. The review area also provides a motion review mode, allowing real-time scrubbing of video footage for any objects of interest that Frigate may have missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate 0.14's UI will likely change the way you review your camera footage. It's a big change, but we love it and hope you do too. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/discussions/11136"&gt;the announcement post&lt;/a&gt; for more information regarding the motivation, ideas, and design decisions behind the new UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new home page for Frigate is intended to be a real-time dashboard for your cameras. Recent alerts are represented by animated thumbnails in a filmstrip view above your camera feeds. Your camera images update once per minute when no detectable activity is occurring to conserve bandwidth and resources. As soon as any motion is detected, cameras seamlessly switch to a full-resolution live stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom camera groups are now supported. Add any of your cameras (including the Birdseye camera) to user-definable groups and easily toggle between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On desktops and tablets, cameras in a camera group can be resized and rearranged via dragging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-18 at 18 00 22 PM" src="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/assets/14866235/b4248c21-9f1b-49f8-8b14-f5fb44c6163c" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Live View&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking a camera from the dashboard will bring up a full-resolution live view where you can quickly access historical footage, use PTZ controls, toggle camera audio, use two-way talk, and more. Zooming with pinch or a scroll wheel is also supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-18 at 18 02 30 PM" src="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/assets/14866235/ac4609d0-6cce-4cdf-b366-0d6a1b0d0230" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Review area of Frigate 0.14 is for quickly reviewing historical footage of interest from your cameras. Review items are indicated on a vertical timeline and displayed as a grid of &lt;em&gt;previews&lt;/em&gt; - bandwidth-optimized, low frame rate, low resolution videos. Hovering over or swiping a preview plays the video and marks it as reviewed. If more in-depth analysis is required, the preview can be clicked/tapped and the full frame rate, full resolution recording is displayed. Review items are filterable by date, object type, and camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-18 at 18 01 12 PM" src="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/assets/14866235/e40e1352-07f0-435c-a9b0-fdbaa60629bf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alerts and Detections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every segment of video captured by Frigate may be of the same level of interest to you. Video of people who enter your property are a different priority than those walking by on the sidewalk. For this reason, Frigate 0.14 categorizes review items as &lt;em&gt;alerts&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;detections&lt;/em&gt;. By default, all &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;car&lt;/em&gt; objects are considered alerts. You can refine categorization of your review items by configuring required zones for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/review"&gt;review docs for more information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Motion review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Frigate 0.13, there isn’t a way to see motion activity on a timeline and watch video at that time. The ability to scrub video for things Frigate missed has been one of the most common feature requests. Within the Motion tab of the Review section, you can now scrub through the timeline for all cameras simultaneously with a timeline showing relative motion activity. In order to avoid scrubbing over time periods already included in alerts and detections, you can also scrub in motion only mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/assets/569905/a21a16b1-f8d2-4af9-beb7-6d17c49cccaa" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Frigate 0.14, full frame rate, full resolution camera footage (called "recordings" in earlier versions) can be viewed and scrubbed via a timeline. Previews of your other cameras are displayed and scrubbed alongside the main selected camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exporting footage from the History view has been drastically improved. Choose predefined time periods, enter a time directly, or drag handles on the timeline to select an export range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past exports can be viewed, renamed, deleted, and downloaded from the dedicated Export pane, accessible from the navigation bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Notable UI Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System stats&lt;/strong&gt; - New charts and graphs with colored segments to track system usage history and more quickly identify problems or issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status bar&lt;/strong&gt; - A new status bar gives at-a-glance CPU/GPU usage as well as any problems or issues with Frigate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New log viewer&lt;/strong&gt; - The log viewer now provides a pane with links to solutions for common issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time motion tuning&lt;/strong&gt; - Tune motion detection settings for your cameras without editing your config file and restarting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New mask and zone editor&lt;/strong&gt; - Edit your masks and zones with a much-improved editor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate now supports authentication. Frigate manages users and authentication using JWT tokens via a cookie or authorization header. Additionally, a new proxy section in the config allows you to use the user header passed from common authentication proxies such as authelia, authentik, oauth2_proxy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication is enforced on a new port 8971, and port 5000 is still unauthenticated for backwards compatibility. If you want to use Frigate's authentication, update your reverse proxy to point at port 8971 instead of 5000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for role based authorization (admin/user roles) will come in a future release and will support upstream authentication proxies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Home Assistant integration needs to be pointed at port 5000. Some recommended configuration examples are in the &lt;a href="https://docs.frigate.video/integrations/home-assistant#configuration"&gt;updated docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/authentication"&gt;the documentation for more information.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TLS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Authentication should really be used over secure connections, TLS is also enabled by default for port 8971. It can be disabled in the config file with the following yaml:
&lt;code&gt;yaml
tls:
  enabled: False&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom certificates can also be used following the &lt;a href="https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/tls"&gt;tls docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frigate+&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frigate 0.14 now offers a dedicated page for Frigate+ submissions, allowing more specific filtering by score and a faster workflow. Support has also been added to upload frames directly from the History view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Other notable improvements&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loitering Time&lt;/strong&gt; - Zones now support a &lt;code&gt;loitering_time&lt;/code&gt; configuration which can be used to only consider an object as part of a zone if they loiter for the specified number of seconds. This can be used, for example, to create alerts for cars that stop on the street but not cars that just drive past your camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-way talk&lt;/strong&gt; - For supported cameras, two-way talk can be used directly from a camera's live view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PWA-optimized&lt;/strong&gt; - The UI has been optimized to work as a progressive web app. Pin Frigate to your iOS home screen or install on Android for a full app-like experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rockchip boards now support object detection&lt;/strong&gt; -  See &lt;a href="https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/object_detectors/#rockchip-platform"&gt;the Rockchip documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic hardware acceleration&lt;/strong&gt; - automatic detection and configuration of hardware acceleration for ffmpeg is attempted on startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New review related MQTT topics and API endpoints&lt;/strong&gt; - New MQTT topics and api endpoints are available for reviews. These will likely be a better topic for notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fixes and changes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better ONVIF support - PTZ controls will now show for more ONVIF PTZ cameras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use ZMQ for interprocess communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hwaccel_args are now automatically detected for Nvidia, AMD, and Intel based systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stationary object detection has been improved especially for parked cars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional support for IPV6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RTMP has been removed (after previous deprecation). This is handled by the automatic config migration upon upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;

Look at the most updated list of FAQs &lt;a href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/discussions/12724"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/discussions"&gt;open a discussion&lt;/a&gt; on Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Upgrade issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm seeing "add mask expects relative coordinates only" in my logs.&lt;/strong&gt; 
This is usually caused by a mask or zone having coordinates larger than the camera's &lt;code&gt;detect&lt;/code&gt; resolution. The easiest fix would be to remove the mask/zone, restart Frigate, and use the new mask/zone editor to recreate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened to all my events?&lt;/strong&gt;
An entirely new way of reviewing camera footage has been implemented in Frigate 0.14, so any "events" from any previous versions of Frigate will not be migrated and will not be visible in the new UI. This includes any favorited/starred events. Recordings can still be viewed in the new UI using the recordings viewer (From Live view, click/tap on a camera and select the &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt; button at the top left).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm seeing "Preview Not Found" in the UI a lot. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;
Frigate 0.14 now generates "previews": bandwidth-optimized, low frame rate, low resolution videos for your camera footage. These previews are not generated for any footage from older versions of Frigate. Historical full recordings are still viewable from your cameras, however. From Live view, click/tap on a camera and select the &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt; button at the top left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any tutorials or videos on how to use the new version?&lt;/strong&gt;
Yes, see the &lt;a href="https://app.supademo.com/showcase/clvi4jyof0kpfh7gr9921vsb7"&gt;guided demo&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJa3dNEO5qQ"&gt;helpful walkthrough video from a user&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I make the cameras take up more space on my dashboard?&lt;/strong&gt;
Yes you can, on desktop screens only. Create a camera group, and then use the edit layout button (bottom right) to resize/reposition your cameras on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is Birdseye view in the new UI?&lt;/strong&gt;
Birdseye is accessible by creating a camera group and adding the Birdseye camera to the camera group. Birdseye is also accessible by navigating directly to &lt;code&gt;frigate_ip:port/#birdseye&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are there black bars and empty space around my cameras in the new Live dashboard?&lt;/strong&gt;
Cameras are kept in a standard 16x9 aspect ratio grid layout. If your camera's aspect ratio is not 16x9 (or a multiple of 16x9 like a wide angle 32x9), black bars may appear on any of the sides of the camera image. One solution would be to adjust your camera's resolution in firmware to fit any multiple of the 16x9 aspect ratio. You could also use Birdseye, which is Frigate's solution for an automatic live view layout without black bars. See the &lt;a href="https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/birdseye#birdseye-layout"&gt;Birdseye docs&lt;/a&gt; for ways to configure Birdseye's resolution, aspect ratio, and layout preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It doesn't seem like my cameras are streaming on the Live dashboard. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;
On the Live dashboard, your camera images will update once per minute when no detectable activity is occurring to conserve bandwidth and resources. As soon as any motion is detected, cameras seamlessly switch to a full-resolution live stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I export footage from the review screen?&lt;/strong&gt;
Yes, right click (desktop) or long press (mobile) to choose item(s) you want to export, then press the export button in the header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened to the timelapse export feature?&lt;/strong&gt;
It's not in the UI, but the API is still available. Most users were using that feature to create videos to manually review each day. One of the main focuses of the new UI was to ensure that isn't necessary. The only remaining use cases we are aware of are for very long periods of time. Having frigate do long exports on high resolution recordings on the server is a really inefficient way to accomplish that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I view snapshots with bounding boxes?&lt;/strong&gt;
Snapshots have been deprecated in favor of the new review item format. To understand why, consider the situation where two people, one with a dog, walked past your house. At the same time, a car drove by on the street behind them. In this scenario, Frigate would have tracked 4 "events". One for each person, the dog, and the car. In 0.13, you would have had 4 separate videos to watch, even though they would have all overlapped. In 0.14, these separate objects are combined into a single review item which represents the period in time where these objects were active on the camera. Reviews for a single camera cannot overlap. Displaying separate snapshots for this scenario in a way that shows they are connected is not only difficult, but also less helpful than having a combined thumbnail and easy to view video preview that quickly shows what exactly happened. Even though snapshots are no longer available in the 0.14 UI review pipeline, they are still available in the Frigate+ view, on the filesystem, and viewable through Home Assistant's media browser. A screen to help debug review items and answer the question "why was this review item created?" will be coming in a future version (feature request is &lt;a href="https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/issues/11399"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I tune what I see in alerts and detections?&lt;/strong&gt;
You can restrict alerts and detections to specific objects/labels or exclude a camera entirely. See the &lt;a href="https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/review"&gt;review docs&lt;/a&gt;. You can also restrict alerts and detections to objects entering zones. The Camera Settings screen in the UI provides a lot of granular control. See the &lt;a href="https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/zones#restricting-alerts-and-detections-to-specific-zones"&gt;zone docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I switch the live view type?&lt;/strong&gt;
In Frigate 0.13, a dropdown menu in the UI allowed users to select between jsmpeg, MSE, or WebRTC. In 0.14, Frigate intelligently selects the best type of live view method for the cameras on your dashboard based on network conditions and features, so this is no longer user selectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I "star" or "favorite" events like in 0.13?&lt;/strong&gt;
No, that feature has been removed in 0.14 in favor of Exports. If you have footage you'd like to "favorite" or retain in 0.14, use the export tools. Unlike favorite events in 0.13, exported footage in 0.14 can be given a label/name and is searchable from the Exports page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any keyboard shortcuts in the UI for desktop devices?&lt;/strong&gt;
Yes. In the Review pane, Ctrl/Cmd-A selects all of your review items. On Live camera view, you can use the arrow keys along with + and - to control a PTZ camera. In the Logs view, page up/page down and arrow up/arrow down will scroll the logs. Wherever video controls appear (History view, Motion Review), the left and right arrows will seek the video backwards and forwards by 10 seconds. The up and down arrow keys will seek the video by 1 second. The "f" key toggles fullscreen, "m" toggles muting, and the space bar toggles playback/pause. &lt;/p&gt;
