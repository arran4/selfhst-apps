    <title>New release for BigBlueButton: v3.0.0</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This is the official release of BigBlueButton 3.0, the culmination of over 18 months of development, 4496 commits, 7 alpha, 7 beta, and 4 release candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="3 0" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65fc3f87-815d-48e9-8bb7-768384cb5fe5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a major release of BigBlueButton and contains multiple new and improved features
* Support for plugins to extend the functionality of the core
* Improved chat with editing, adding emojis, and follow-up messages
* Improved whiteboard a build of tldraw 2.0
* Join audio with microphone (able to configure no more listen-only/microphone)
* Improved Away mode (one click to set away)
* Push to talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial (experimental) support was added for
* Integration with LiveKit for audio, webcams and screen share
* Infinite whiteboard
* Support for ClamAV as presentation file scanner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release includes significant refactor of the code base and re-envisioning the architecture of the client and the components supporting it.  Specifically, we removed all of mongo and meteor and replaced it with Hasura and GraphQL communication.  This restructuring enabled optimization of the user list, chat, and all other communications, which resulted in improved stability and performance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also updated all the components so BigBlueButton 3.0 installs on Ubuntu 22.04.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link to the installation command / instructions/ full list of features: https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/3.0/new-features/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The focus of BigBlueButton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we created BigBlueButton in 2007, we created it with the mission to build the world's most effective virtual classroom measured in learning outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created it to empower educators with built-in tools for active learning and live analytics to ensure every student learns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with UN Sustainable Development Goal # 4: &lt;strong&gt;Quality Education for Everyone&lt;/strong&gt;, we believe every student in the world deserves a high quality online learning experience. And we believe every educator deserves the best platform to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as an open-source platform, BigBlueButton is freely available worldwide.  If you are in education and teach students in live sessions, we built BigBlueButton for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we evolve BigBlueButton 3.0, the new plug-in architecture enables the product to be used in other areas of communication.  At the core, BigBlueButton 3.0 is an extensible platform with all the core collaboration features you would find in a commercial web conferencing system.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks to our Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BigBlueButton project is supported by a world-wide community of developers, teachers, testers, and government, commercial, and educational organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this release, we want to thank in particular the following organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thank &lt;strong&gt;ZKI&lt;/strong&gt;, the German association of Higher Education IT centers, for its members that have collectively supported the overall development for this release. Notably, sponsoring the integration of LiveKit into BigBlueButton. We also thank the German Universities that have tested earlier builds of this release and given feedback and helped improve the overall quality of this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thank the &lt;strong&gt;French Ministry of Education&lt;/strong&gt; who have supported the development of features in this release, including being able to edit, delete, reply to and react to a chat message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thank the many translators who helped ensure that BigBlueButton is localized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big THANK YOU to all community members who helped for this release - 
both through sending pull requests and through reporting bugs or requesting enhancements! :confetti_ball: &lt;/p&gt;
