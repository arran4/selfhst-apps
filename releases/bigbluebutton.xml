    <content>&lt;p&gt;In this iteration we have patched a whiteboard issue (introduced in BBB 3.0.2) causing excessive logging in the browser console (repeated logging of a single error) which also led to higher rate of logs for nginx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix(html5): Memoize whiteboard custom UI overrides config by @JoVictorNunes in https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/22715&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Changelog&lt;/strong&gt;: https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/compare/v3.0.2...v3.0.3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Release name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing &lt;code&gt;-v jammy-300&lt;/code&gt; to https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install/blob/v3.0.x-release/bbb-install.sh will always install the latest released BigBlueButton 3.0 version.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you would like to install this specific release, pass &lt;code&gt;-v jammy-300-3.0.3&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still recommend using &lt;code&gt;-v jammy-300&lt;/code&gt; as this repository is continually updated with each BigBlueButton 3.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Client build: 1147&lt;/h3&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for BigBlueButton: v3.0.7</title>
    <updated>2025-05-12T11:29:48-04:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;The main focus of this iteration are improvements to the breakout rooms, external video (youtube) share and presentation conversion.
LiveKit support has been improved and some whiteboard edge cases have been handled. For those who had previously set up the LiveKit integration, we recommend reviewing the installation steps as there may be actions needed regarding recording and network configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Some BigBlueButton plugins now support other languages. If you are seeing things like "pickRandomUserPlugin.actionsButtonDropdown.label.pickUser" instead of the label, check for a newer tag/version of the plugin on github. We welcome translation contributions to the plugins as we are propagating the translation support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of the pull requests in this iteration, grouped by component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/3.0/new-features&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big THANK YOU to all community members who helped for this release - both through sending pull requests and through reporting bugs or requesting enhancements! :confetti_ball:&lt;/p&gt;
