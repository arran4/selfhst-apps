    <title>New release for Formbricks: v2.7.0</title>
    <updated>2024-11-08T06:41:56-05:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Formbricks v2.7 includes all the features and improvements developed by the community during Hacktoberfest 2024 🔥.
With this release, Formbricks is not only available in English, but also in German and Brazilian Portuguese 🇩🇪🇧🇷&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also introduce an advanced team-based access control system (requires Formbricks Enterprise Edition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the contributors who help make Formbricks more robust and powerful. 💪🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!IMPORTANT]  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Database update ⚠️&lt;/strong&gt; This release sets the foundation for our upcoming AI features, currently in private beta. Formbricks now
  requires the &lt;code&gt;pgvector&lt;/code&gt; extension to be installed in the PostgreSQL database. For users of our one-click
  setup, simply use the &lt;code&gt;pgvector/pgvector:pg15&lt;/code&gt; image instead of &lt;code&gt;postgres:15-alpine&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!IMPORTANT]  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Data migration required ⚠️&lt;/strong&gt; This release includes a data migration to handle the changes on the access role feature. Please follow the &lt;a href="https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/migration-guide"&gt;instructions on the Migration page&lt;/a&gt; in the docs to learn how to run the data migration needed.&lt;/p&gt;
