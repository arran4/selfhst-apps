* Details for individual tiles can be expanded and collapsed by clicking a tile when the <b>Details</b> toggle is disabled
* Closed source projects can now be filtered when browsing the directory using the <b>Closed Source</b> toggle at the top of the page
* Project icons not found in the [dashboard-icons](https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons) repository are now being maintained and stored in the project's repository. The work has been started to transition all icons to independent maintenance to eventually be loaded as sprites for optimization purposes.
